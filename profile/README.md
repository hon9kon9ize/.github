We are a dedicated group of individuals who share a deep passion for Cantonese culture, language, and the field of machine learning.

Cantonese, being a low-resource language, has inspired us to contribute our extensive knowledge and expertise to the community, with the aim of making Cantonese more accessible to all.

In addition, we are actively seeking like-minded individuals who share our enthusiasm for both Cantonese and machine learning. If you are interested in joining us on this exciting journey, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.
